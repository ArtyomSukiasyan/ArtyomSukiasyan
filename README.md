# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile
I'm a former professional chess player and trainer who switched to development and started making websites and mobile apps. I love coding and spend an average of 14 hours a day on programming.

You can see more about my education and work experience on my 
[portfolio website.](https://devchessplayer.com/).

In addition to work and various features in Github, I also created several websites and mobile application for the development of chess.

## My sites
- https://chessarbiter.info/en/ - A handbook of chess rules
- https://chessnews.am/ - Chess news in Armenia and the world
- https://ararat.chessnews.am/ - The website of the Ararat Region Chess Federation

## My app for android
- [Chess Arbiter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chessarbiter) - Mobile app for handbook with some new features

## Work

Currently I work in [Devs Software Design](https://devs.ae/) as Javascript Engineer.

## Free time

In my free time I create various features and publish them here

## Besides programming

I am fond of psychology, I like to walk, read books, listen to music, hiking, climbing and, of course, play chess.
