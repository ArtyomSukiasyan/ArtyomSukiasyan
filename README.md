# Artyom Sukiasyan

I'm a software engineer passionate about education, problem-solving  and open source. 

My background as a professional chess player taught me to think analytically and find optimal solutions. I love writing clear, reusable code and have live open-source projects to share. I'm always learning and improving my craft.

## Open source fun projects

In my free time I create various features and publish them in my Github. Below you can see some of my projects.
